# Tanzania-Sreets-API \n This is under development it use php, mysql and downloaded csv files, what is done is reading all data in these csv files and create tables to hold streets seperately from districts, seperately from region so each stage use its own table, NB I used POSTCODE as primary key for each region to Wards and on streets table i used auto increment to create the primary key which used as foreign key in places.
